🧑‍💻 About Me – Juan Miranda

Juan Miranda | Frontend Developer
Montevideo, Uruguay · Durazno Studio

I’m passionate about creating clean, usable, and accessible interfaces — combining creativity and logic to build web experiences that delight users and work seamlessly.

With strong knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React, I’ve designed and developed online stores, landing pages, interactive portfolios, and more.

What I focus on:

Building responsive and reusable components optimized for all devices.

Following best coding practices for clean and maintainable architecture.

Improving performance, accessibility, and user experience in every project.

Currently, I’m part of the Durazno Studio team in Montevideo, where I collaborate on digital projects from concept to launch.
I’m always learning new technologies, exploring modern frontend tools, and contributing to open-source projects.
